## Features

The Book Talk App includes the following features and functionality:

### Books

- **Global Header & Footer**: Users can access their profile, links to social media, and the developer's GitHub profile.

- **Home Page**: The home page features a popular books carousel, showcasing the highest-rated books displayed using a swiper, an introduction, and an explore section to see all books. Additionally, it has a header/navbar with a search bar, functional dark/light mode, and an icon displaying the logged-in user's image, from which they can access their profile.

- **Sorting and Filtering**: Users can sort books based on various criteria such as title, genre, author, rating, and reviews count. They can also choose to show books of a specific genre only.

- **Pagination**: The list of books is initially limited to 18, with a "Load More" button at the bottom of the page to load additional books.

- **Book Page**: When a book card is selected, users are redirected to the book page displaying the full book, including the title, image URL, description, author, publisher, Amazon book URL, ISBN, genre, average rating, and a list of reviews.

- **Posting Books**: Logged-in users can post new books.

### Reviews

- **Displaying Reviews**: Reviews are displayed on the related book's page.

- **Posting, Updating, and Deleting Reviews**: Logged-in users can post reviews on books, update their own reviews, and delete their own reviews.

- **Ratings**: Reviews include a rating from logged-in users. The application calculates and displays the average rating for each book. Users can also update their ratings.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: Users can sign up and sign in using cookies for authentication. This ensures a secure and personalized experience.

- **Admin Privileges**: Only the Admin user has the ability to delete books from the platform.
